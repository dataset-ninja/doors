**Doors: Dataset for Boulders Segmentation** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the space research, and in the safety industry. 

The dataset consists of 80452 images with 80345 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*boulder*).

Images in the Doors dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 107 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (50276 images), *test* (20088 images), and *val* (10088 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 dataset: ***ds1*** (45269 images) and ***ds2*** (35183 images), or into 2 test dataset: ***test1*** (10088 images) and ***test2*** (10000 images), or into 5 rendering params: ***albedo of the boulder*** (45269 images), ***albedo of the surface*** (45269 images), ***boulder id*** (45269 images), ***boulder scale*** (45269 images), and ***intensity of the sun*** (45269 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Department of Aerospace Science and Technology, Italy.
