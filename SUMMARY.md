**DOORS: Dataset fOr bOuldeRs Segmentation** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the space research, and in the safety industry. 

The dataset consists of 80452 images with 80345 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*boulder*).

Images in the DOORS dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 107 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 8 splits in the dataset: *ds1 train* (30181 images), *ds2 train* (20095 images), *ds1 test1* (5044 images), *ds1 val* (5044 images), *ds2 test1* (5044 images), *ds2 val* (5044 images), *ds1 test2* (5000 images), and *ds2 test2* (5000 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 5 rendering params: ***albedo of the boulder*** (45269 images), ***albedo of the surface*** (45269 images), ***boulder id*** (45269 images), ***boulder scale*** (45269 images), and ***intensity of the sun*** (45269 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Department of Aerospace Science and Technology, Italy.
